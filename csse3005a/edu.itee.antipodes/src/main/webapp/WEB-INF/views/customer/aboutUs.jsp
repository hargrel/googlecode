<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>This is the website of Antipodes World Travel, a well established travel agency with
over 30 years experience in assisting customers with international holiday travel. Over the last 10
years, our company has taken advantage of the growing trend in customers seeking eco-adventure
tours. These tours typically take people to remote, often difficult-to-reach, locations and involve
activities such as scuba diving, kayaking, mountain climbing or wildlife spotting. Although there
are some big operators in this area, most of the tour operators are small offering only one or two
specialised tours. To assist customers finding out about such tours, we have established an
extensive directory of such operators throughout the world.</p>
